<h1 align="center">Spotify Music Player Bot</h1>

This bot is a music player for Discord servers that allows users to play and search for songs on Spotify. It uses the `Spotipy` library to search for songs and retrieve track information, including preview URLs. Users can search for songs using the `search` command, and select a song from the list of search results to play. The bot also includes commands for playing a specific song, skipping to the next song in the queue, and disconnecting from the voice channel.
